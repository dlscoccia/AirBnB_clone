# AirBnB clone - The Console

## Summary

This is the first moduele of the AirBnB Clone project, wich consists in a command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging). 

with this module we are going to be able to manage the objects of the whole  project:

* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

# AirBnB clone - Web static

This is the second part of the AirBnB clone project. In this folder is allocated the files for the static web, which is part of the Client side (front-end).

A static web page (sometimes called a flat page or a stationary page) is a web page that is delivered to the user's web browser exactly as stored, in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application.

Consequently, a static web page displays the same information for all users, from all contexts, subject to modern capabilities of a web server to negotiate content-type or language of the document where such versions are available and the server is configured to do so.
